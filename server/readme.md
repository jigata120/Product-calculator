# Practice Server

## Usage

This is **REST service**, created for educational purposes. To execute it, open a command prompt and run `node server.js`.

```
> cd server
> node server.js
```

Note that changes to the data **will not be persisted**! All operations happen in memory and will be wiped when the service is restarted.
